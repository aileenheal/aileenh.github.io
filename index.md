# FOSS4GUK Workshop: Loading OS MasterMap into PostGIS Using Loader #
This workshop is a simple introduction to using Loader to load OS MasterMap Topography Layer and other OS OpenData(TM) datasets into PostGIS.

# Useful Links #
[Loader Repository](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader)

[Loader wiki](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki)

[Loader Configuration Examples](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Configuration-examples)


# Prerequisites #
For this workshop we are going to use the [Portable GIS](http://www.archaeogeek.com/portable-gis.html) for convenience as it has everything we need in one simple install.

Obviously in a production environment you would not use the Portable GIS, in which case see the [Loader Installation Documentation](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Installation) on how ot install Loader.

You can download and install PostgreSQL from [EnterpriseDB](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows).

Once you have installed PostgreSQL you cna install PostGIS using Stack Builder.

# Data #
For this workshop I have package up a small sample of data to be used which can be downloaded from [here](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZi3VbZ88KyhH4PqaFYGzyY7xRyxh8xn3My).

If you are going to repeat this workshop at home or work I would recommend you download bigger sample data sets for the OS website.

[OS MasterMap, VectorMap Local, AddressBase etc](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/licensing/sample-data/discover-data.html).

[OS OpenData(TM)](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html).
