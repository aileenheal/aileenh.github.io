# FOSS4GUK Workshop: Using Loader #
This workshop is a simple introduction to using Loader to load OS MasterMap Topography Layer and other OS OpenData datasets into PostGIS.

# Useful Links #
[Loader Repository](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader)

[Loader wiki](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki)

[Loader Configuration Examples](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Configuration-examples)


# Prerequisits #
For this workshop we are going to use the [Portable GIS] (http://www.archaeogeek.com/portable-gis.html) for convience as it has everything we need in one simple install.

Obviously in a productions environment you would probably not use the Portable GIS, in which case see [Loader installation documentation] (https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Installation).

You can download and install PostgreSQL and PostGIS from [EnterpriseDB] (http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows).

# Data #
For this workshop I have package up a small sample of data to be used which can be downloaded here.

If you are going to repeat this workshop at home or work I woudl recommend you download bigger sample data sets for the OS website.

[OS MasterMap, VectorMap Local, AddressBase etc] (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/licensing/sample-data/discover-data.html).

[OS OpenData(TM)] (https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html).
