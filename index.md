## FOSS4GUK Workshop: Using Loader ##
This workshop is a simple introduction to using Loader to load OS MasterMap and other OS OpenData datasets into PostGIS.

## Useful Links ##
[Loader Repository](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader)

[Loader wiki](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki)

[Loader Configuration Examples](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Configuration-examples)


## Prerequisits ##
For this workshop we are going to use the [Portable GIS] (http://www.archaeogeek.com/portable-gis.html) for convience as it has everything we need in one simpel install.

Obviously in a productions environment you would probably not use the Portable GIS, in which case see [Loader installation documentation] (https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader/wiki/Installation).

You can download and install PostgreSQL and PostGIS from [EnterpriseDB] (http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows)
